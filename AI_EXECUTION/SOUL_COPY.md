# Soul Copy for Threshold Compass

## 1. Integration Strategy
Integrating the lightweight `threshold-tracker` PWA with its offline-first IndexedDB, and the comprehensive `threshold-compass` Next.js application powered by Supabase, creates a resilient and powerful user experience. The `threshold-tracker` serves as your immediate, always-available field journal, perfect for environments where connectivity is unreliable or privacy is paramount. It's designed for rapid, unencumbered logging, ensuring no data point is lost. `threshold-compass`, on the other hand, is your command center—authenticated, full-featured, offering deep analytics, visualizations, and secure cloud storage. We recommend using `threshold-tracker` as your primary offline capture tool, a robust companion for on-the-go data entry. For comprehensive insights, trend analysis, and long-term data stewardship, `threshold-compass` is your core operational hub. A seamless JSON export from the tracker and import into the compass provides a clear, reliable migration path, ensuring your journey's data is never siloed and always ready for deeper analysis. This dual-app approach provides both rugged field utility and sophisticated basecamp intelligence.

## 2. Onboarding Welcome Screen
Welcome, trailblazer. You are not signing up; you are initiating a journey of self-calibration. This instrument, Threshold Compass, is your bearing to true north, a tool designed not for following generic protocols, but for mapping your unique inner landscape. Prepare to navigate with precision.

## 3. Discovery Protocol Explanation
The 10-Dose Discovery Protocol is not some rehashed dogma; it's our proprietary methodology for precise self-mapping. The initial four doses are crucial for establishing your baseline, illuminating the fundamental energetic shifts and sensory signatures of the compound within your unique system. This foundational data anchors our understanding. The subsequent six doses expand this mapping, allowing us to factor in varying contexts—different environments, activities, and states of mind. This isn't the Fadiman protocol, nor any other off-the-shelf guide. This is a rigorous, iterative process designed to yield a deeply personalized understanding of your optimal range, making your journey from ambiguity to clarity feel essential, not merely administrative.

## 4. Batch Empty State Copy
No batches yet? Let's fix that. Your dose's potency can swing wildly—we're talking 5x to 40x variation between sources. In wildland firefighting, precision is the difference between control and catastrophe. The same applies here. Tracking your batches isn't optional; it's critical for understanding your experience, ensuring safety, and achieving reliable results. Without a batch logged, your data is incomplete, and your compass lacks a true bearing.

## 5. Range Reveal Text
**LOW:** Below this, you're not getting enough signal to matter.
