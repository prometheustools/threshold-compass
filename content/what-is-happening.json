      "tryThis": "Let it happen. Don't suppress. Each yawn is your nervous system recalibrating.",
      "whyItWorks": "Yawning is a serotonergic response, not tiredness. Psilocybin activates 5-HT2A receptors, which trigger this cascade. It's a sign the medicine is working, not that you're tired.",
